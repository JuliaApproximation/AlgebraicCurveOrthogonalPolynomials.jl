\def\C{\tilde C}

Consider for $t > 1$
$$
\Omega = \{ (x,y) : y^2 \leq \underbrace{(1-x^2) (t-x)}_{\rho(x)}, -1 \leq x \leq 1\}
$$
Define
$$
P_{nk}(x,y) := \C_{n-k}^{(k+1)}(x) \rho(x)^{k/2} P_k(y/\rho(x))
$$
where $P_k$ are Legendre polynomials and $\C_k^{(\lambda)}$ are monic semiclassical ultraspherical polynomials, orthogonal w.r.t. $\rho(x)^{\lambda-1/2}$. Denote its norm-squared as
$$
h_k^{(\lambda)} := \int_{-1}^1 \C_k^{(\lambda)}(x)^2 \rho(x)^{\lambda-1/2} \D x
$$
Note $P_{nk}(x,y)$ are orthogonal w.r.t. 
$$
\ip<f,g> := \int_{-1}^1 \int_{-\rho(x)}^{\rho(x)}  f(x,y) g(x,y) \D y \D x
$$
since, with $t = y/\sqrt{\rho(x)}$ we have
$$
\ip<P_{nk},P_{mj}> = \int_{-1}^1 \C_{n-k}^{(k+1)}(x) \C_{m-j}^{(j+1)}(x)  \rho(x)^{(k+j+1)/2} \D x \int_{-1}^1 P_k(t) P_j(t) \D t
$$
Denote it's norm-squared as
$$
h_{nk}^P := \ip<P_{nk},P_{nk}> = h_{n-k}^{(k+1)} h_k^P
$$
where $h_k^P$ are the Legendre norms.


Let's denote the true OPs as $R$, and we know the first 5:
$$
R_{00} := P_{00} | R_{10} := P_{10}, R_{11} := P_{11} | R_{20} := P_{20}, R_{21} := P_{21}
$$
Here we use a total lexicographical ordering of polynomials whenever we talk about "lower order terms". 

\subsection{Quadratic case}

The catch: $P_{nk}$ does not include all polynomials, so for example $R_{22} \neq P_{22}$ since
$$
P_{22}(x,y) = \rho(x) P_2(y/\rho(x)) = {3 \over 2} y^2 - {\rho(x) \over 2} = -{x^3 \over 2} + {\rm l.o.t}
$$
which is cubic in $x$. Idea is to use 
$$
P_{30}(x,y) = \C_3^{(1)}(x) = x^3 + O(x^2)
$$ 
to kill of the cubic term via
$$
R_{22} := P_{22} + {P_{30} \over 2} = {3\over 2} y^2 + {\rm l.o.t.}
$$
Note this is indeed an OP since for lower order polynomials $R_{kj}$ we have
$$
\ip<R_{22},R_{kj}> = \ip<R_{22},P_{kj}> = \ip<P_{22},P_{kj}> + {\ip<P_{30},P_{kj}> \over 2} = 0.
$$
If we denote
$$
h_{nk}^R := \ip<R_{nk},R_{nk}>
$$
we have
$$
h_{22}^R = h_{22}^P + {h_{30}^P \over 2}
$$

\subsection{Cubic case}

The catch, $R_{30} \neq P_{30}$ since 
$$
\ip<P_{30},R_{22}> = {\ip<P_{30}, P_{30}> \over 2} = {h_{30}^P \over 2}  (= {h_3^{(1)} \over 2})
$$
But the solution is simple:
$$
R_{30} := P_{30} - {h_{30}^P \over 2 h_{22}^R} R_{22}
$$
Fortunately the next term is fine
$$
R_{31} := P_{31}
$$
since all l.o.t. $R_{nk}$ are sums of l.o.t. $P_{nk}$. Now note
$$
P_{32}(x,y) = \C_1^{(2)}(x) \pr( {3 \over 2} y^2 - {\rho(x) \over 2} ) = -{x^4 \over 2} + {\rm l.o.t.}
$$
So
$$
R_{32} := P_{32} + {P_{40} \over 2}.
$$
Finally
$$
P_{33}(x,y) = {5 \over 2} y^3 - {3 \over 2} \rho(x) y = - {3 \over 2} x^3 y + {\rm l.o.t.}
$$
Here we use
$$
P_{41}(x,y) = \C_3^{(2)}(x) y = x^3 y + {\rm l.o.t}
$$
so we define
$$
R_{33} := P_{33} + {3 \over 2} P_{41}
$$

\subsection{Quartic case}

$$
R_{40} := P_{40} - {h_{40}^P \over 2 h_{32}^R} R_{32}
$$

$$
R_{41} := P_{41} - {3 h_{41}^P \over 2 h_{33}^R} R_{33}
$$

$$
R_{42} := P_{42} + {P_{50} \over 2}
$$

$$
R_{43} := P_{43} + {3 \over 2} P_{51}
$$

The next term is the hard one as we now have two "bad" terms:
$$
P_{44}(x,y)  = {35 \over 8} y^4 - {30 \over 8} \rho(x) y^2 + {3 \rho(x)^2 \over 8} = {3 \over 8} x^6 - {3 \over 4} t x^5 - {30 \over 8} x^3 y^2 + {\rm l.o.t.}
$$
We can clearly kill it off using $P_{60}$, $P_{50}$, $P_{51}$ and $P_{52}$ though it seems that the construction becomes increasingly difficult for quintic and higher.
